Due to boronâ€™s metalloid properties, aromatic boron reagents are prevalent synthetic intermediates. The direct borylation of aryl C-H bonds for producing aromatic boron compounds offers an appealing, one-step solution. Despite significant advances in this field, achieving regioselective aryl C-H bond borylation using simple and readily available starting materials still remains a challenge. In this work, we attempted to enhance the reactivity of the electron-donor-acceptor (EDA) complex by selecting different bases to replace the organic base (NEt<sub>3</sub>) used in our previous research. To our delight, when using NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> as the base, we have achieved a mild visible-light-mediated aromatic C-H bond borylation reaction with exceptional regioselectivity (rr > 40:1 to single isomers). Compared with our previous borylation methodologies, this protocol provides a more efficient and broader scope for aryl C-H bond borylation through the use of N-Bromosuccinimide. The protocolâ€™s good functional-group tolerance and excellent regioselectivity enable the functionalization of a variety of biologically relevant compounds and novel cascade transformations. Mechanistic experiments and theoretical calculations conducted in this study have indicated that, for certain arenes, the aryl C-H bond borylation might proceed through a new reaction mechanism, which involves the formation of a novel transient EDA complex.
