We have developed cobalt-catalyzed, bidentate 2-(1-methylhydrazinyl)pyridine (MHP)-directed C(<i>sp</i><sup>2</sup>)–H alkylation/annulation of benzoic hydrazides with various alkenes. Notably, diverse cyclopenta[<i>c</i>]isoquinolinones and dihydroisoquinolinones were obtained via this functional group-tolerant protocol. The reaction can be performed on a gram scale while maintaining an excellent yield, and the directing group can be removed efficiently under mild conditions. Furthermore, density-functional theory (DFT) calculations provide an incisive understanding of the observed regioselectivities for different olefins.
