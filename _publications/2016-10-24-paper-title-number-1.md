#excerpt: 'Cyanobacterial aldehyde-deformylating oxygenase (cADO) is a nonheme diiron enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of aldehyde to alk(a/e)ne, an important transformation in biofuel research. In this work, we report a highly desired computational study for probing the mechanism of cADO. By combining our QM/MM results with the available <sup>57</sup>Fe Mössbauer spectroscopic data, the gained detailed structural information suggests construction of asymmetry from the symmetric diiron cofactor in an aldehyde substrate and O<sub>2</sub> activation. His160, one of the two iron-coordinate histidine residues in cADO, plays a pivotal role in this asymmetric aldehyde activation process by unprecedented reversible dissociation from the diiron cofactor, a behavior unknown in any other nonheme dinuclear or mononuclear enzymes. The revealed intrinsically asymmetric interactions of the substrate/O<sub>2</sub> with the symmetric cofactor in cADO are inspirational for exploring diiron subsite resolution in other nonheme diiron enzymes.'

Cyanobacterial aldehyde-deformylating oxygenase (cADO) is a nonheme diiron enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of aldehyde to alk(a/e)ne, an important transformation in biofuel research. In this work, we report a highly desired computational study for probing the mechanism of cADO. By combining our QM/MM results with the available <sup>57</sup>Fe Mössbauer spectroscopic data, the gained detailed structural information suggests construction of asymmetry from the symmetric diiron cofactor in an aldehyde substrate and O<sub>2</sub> activation. His160, one of the two iron-coordinate histidine residues in cADO, plays a pivotal role in this asymmetric aldehyde activation process by unprecedented reversible dissociation from the diiron cofactor, a behavior unknown in any other nonheme dinuclear or mononuclear enzymes. The revealed intrinsically asymmetric interactions of the substrate/O<sub>2</sub> with the symmetric cofactor in cADO are inspirational for exploring diiron subsite resolution in other nonheme diiron enzymes.
