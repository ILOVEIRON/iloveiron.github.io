Biological decarboxylation constitutes a promising way to produce biohydrocarbons from widespread fatty acids in various organisms. Capable of catalyzing this transformation to yield biofuels, UndA is a di-iron oxidative decarboxylase that attracts considerable research interest. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical investigations, the corresponding decarboxylation mechanism of UndA remains elusive, partially due to the structural flexibility of its active site. Herein, based on extensive multiscale theoretical simulations, we discovered that conformational adaptions in the first coordination sphere of diiron cofactor play a key role in the decarboxylation mechanism of UndA. Based on the QM/MM MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopic modelings, unlike the previous peroxo assignment, a hydroperoxo structure with the adapted bridging carboxylate ligand is reassigned as the active species to initiate the decarboxylation reaction. Furthermore, different from previous theoretical results, we revealed that the most favorable catalytic mechanism for UndA is the carbonyloxy radical mechanism, in which the substrate-based carbonyloxy radical stabilized by the adaptive bridging ligand E101 is formed, followed by decarboxylation prior to Î²-hydrogen abstraction. The current discovery for UndA implies that the adaptive first coordination sphere can exert a decisive effect in the mechanism of diiron enzymes, which is inspiring for exploring other mechanistically elusive diiron enzymes in the future.
