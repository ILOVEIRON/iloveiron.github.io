<br>Hello! I am Chao Wang. Since May 2023 I have been a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Chemistry at Pennsylvania State University. Supported by the computational resources and funding of Dr. Elvira Sayfutyarova and additional funding from Professors Bollinger and Krebs, I have led and independently executed multiscale simulations of Fe(II)/2-oxoglutarate–dependent enzymes—the ethylene-forming enzyme (EFE) and the L-lysine halogenase (BesD). Working closely with experimentalists in the Bollinger–Krebs groups, I integrate first-hand experimental data into my models; this theory–experiment synergy enables me to predict and analyze the electronic and geometric structures of key intermediates and to elucidate the reaction mechanisms of non-heme iron enzymes.

I received my Ph.D. in Chemistry (theoretical and computational chemistry) in 2019 from the Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences / University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, advisor: Prof. [Hui Chen](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/B-5666-2012). From September 2017 to March 2019, I was a joint-training doctoral student at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem under Prof. [Sason Shaik](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=00k1P-YAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), a prominent theoretical chemist. I earned my B.Sc. in Chemistry Education in 2014 from Shandong University of Technology. After completing my doctorate, I conducted postdoctoral research at Peking University with Prof. [Yundong Wu](https://www.chem.pku.edu.cn/en/People/AcademicStaff/c5bc1350b7ab4f3cb8a5f9e4d20b07f4.htm), focusing on computational physical organic chemistry and organometallic reaction mechanisms.

I am passionate about applying theoretical and computational chemistry to investigate first-row transition-metal enzymes and transition-metal catalysts, deciphering their complex electronic states, reactivity, and structures to uncover new catalytic concepts and mechanisms. My current work combines multiscale QM/MM with Mössbauer spectroscopy simulations and molecular dynamics to predict and interpret transient reactive intermediates’ electronic structures, reaction snapshots, and novel chemistry. I also extend kinetics-based theoretical spectroscopy—encompassing rate-constant calculations, model development, kinetic isotope-effect simulations, and quantum-tunneling corrections—to guide electronic-structure and mechanistic insights. In parallel, I explore oriented electric-field effects in metalloenzyme and organometallic catalysis and perform comprehensive analyses of elementary steps in classic transition-metal reactions using explicit-solvent models that capture diverse hydrogen-bonding environments.

Please visit the [Research](https://iloveiron.github.io/teaching/) & [Publications](https://iloveiron.github.io/publications/) page to learn more about my work and papers. I am currently seeking tenure-track faculty positions in chemistry; a graphic outlining the future research directions of Wang Lab appears below. I look forward to discussing potential collaborations.

Research Vision
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Selected Highlights
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

Career Objective
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
