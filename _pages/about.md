<br>This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads!

Research Vision
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over - just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

Research Interests
======
1. &nbsp;<b>Prediction of Transient Reactive Intermediates:</b> Specialized in identifying and characterizing short-lived mechanistically crucial species using DFT and QM/MM approaches.
1. &nbsp;<b>Electric Field Effects in Catalysis:</b> Experienced in analyzing both external electric fields (EEF) and protein-intrinsic electric fields, revealing their roles in modulating reactivity, selectivity, and transition-state stabilization.
1. &nbsp;<b>Computational Bioinorganic Chemistry:</b> Mechanistic investigations of heme enzymes, non-heme Fe(II) enzymes, diiron oxygenases, and synthetic model complexes using integrated MD, QM/MM, and DFT workflows.
1. &nbsp;<b>Organometallic Reaction Mechanisms:</b> Investigation of transition-metal-catalyzed transformations involving C–H activation, radical intermediates, and multistep reaction pathways.
1. &nbsp;<b>Spectroscopy-Oriented Modeling:</b> Simulation of Mössbauer, EPR, and Raman spectra to support structural assignment of reactive species and intermediates.
1. &nbsp;<b>Quantum Tunneling and KIEs:</b> Modeling hydrogen transfer processes with tunneling corrections to interpret and predict kinetic isotope effects.
1. &nbsp;<b>Theory-Experiment Integration:</b> Providing mechanistic rationale and structural insight to support the design and interpretation of catalytic systems studied experimentally.

Selected Highlights
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

Career Objective
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
