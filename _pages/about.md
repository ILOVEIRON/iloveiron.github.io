<br>Hello! I am Chao Wang. Since May 2023 I have been a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Chemistry at Pennsylvania State University. Supported by the computational resources and funding of Dr. [Elvira Sayfutyarova](https://science.psu.edu/chem/people/evs5812) and additional funding from Professors [Bollinger and Krebs](https://sites.psu.edu/bollingerkrebsgroup/), I have led and independently executed multiscale simulations of nonheme Fe(II)/2-oxoglutarate–dependent enzymes. Working closely with experimentalists in the Bollinger–Krebs groups, I integrate first-hand experimental data into my models; this theory–experiment synergy enables me to predict and analyze the electronic and geometric structures of key intermediates and to elucidate the reaction mechanisms of non-heme iron enzymes.

I received my Ph.D. in Chemistry (theoretical and computational chemistry) in 2019 from the Institute of Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences / University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, advisor: Prof. [Hui Chen](https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/B-5666-2012). From September 2017 to March 2019, I was a joint-training doctoral student at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem under Prof. [Sason Shaik](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=00k1P-YAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), a prominent theoretical chemist. I earned my B.Sc. in Chemistry Education in 2014 from Shandong University of Technology. After completing my doctorate, I conducted postdoctoral research at Peking University with Prof. [Yundong Wu](https://www.chem.pku.edu.cn/en/People/AcademicStaff/c5bc1350b7ab4f3cb8a5f9e4d20b07f4.htm), focusing on computational physical organic chemistry and organometallic reaction mechanisms.

Please visit the [Research](https://iloveiron.github.io/teaching/) & [Publications](https://iloveiron.github.io/publications/) page to learn more about my work and papers. I am currently seeking tenure-track faculty positions in chemistry; a graphic outlining the future research directions of Wang Lab appears below. I look forward to discussing potential collaborations.

Research Vision
======
I am passionate about applying theoretical and computational chemistry to investigate first-row transition-metal enzymes and transition-metal catalysts, deciphering their complex electronic states, reactivity, and structures to uncover new catalytic concepts and mechanisms. My current work combines multiscale QM/MM with Mössbauer spectroscopy simulations and molecular dynamics to predict and interpret transient reactive intermediates’ electronic structures, reaction snapshots, and novel chemistry. I also extend kinetics-based theoretical spectroscopy—encompassing rate-constant calculations, model development, kinetic isotope-effect simulations, and quantum-tunneling corrections—to guide electronic-structure and mechanistic insights. In parallel, I explore oriented electric-field effects in metalloenzyme and organometallic catalysis and perform comprehensive analyses of elementary steps in classic transition-metal reactions using explicit-solvent models that capture diverse hydrogen-bonding environments.

Career Objective
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
